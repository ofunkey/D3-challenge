## Background

In this work, I analyzed the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings.

The data set included with the work is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state, where MOE stands for "margin of error."

* Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`, that represents each state with circle elements. 

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Incorporate click events so that users can decide which data to display.

* Incorporate d3-tip and add tooltips to the circles and display each tooltip with the data that user has selected.
